Inspired by AGDQ2018s theme, I programmed this Binary Timer. Each column represents one digit of the timer, the overall run time is limited to 59:59.9 minutes.  
A few weeks prior to AGDQ2018 I learned about the binary number system in the base.cs podcast. This was the perfect opportunity to display the concept of binary.

ðŸ”¥ On January 28th the Binary Timer got featured in the Picked Pens on codepen.

**Made with:**  
â€¢ HTML5  
â€¢ CSS3  
â€¢ vanilla JavaScript
